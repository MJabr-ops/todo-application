# todo-application
simple todo application for testing and using technologies like Redis and DRF with django framework


this application is not completed yet still got a little work to perfection!!

first you need to register or login to your profile and then do basic operations (CRUD) on your todo collections.


application is on debug mode.

because of simple structure of applications model ,i use django ORM to make development process faster .

Redis used on some views for caching .

this application uses JWT authentication so be aware of tokens :) ,token prefix is 'Token' so use it in your requests header.
